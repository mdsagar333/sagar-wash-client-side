# [SAGAR WASH](https://sagar-wash-f4986.web.app/) is a laundry service website. It has 4 types of services. And the services are laundry, dry cleaning, ironing, and alter&sweing. A user can order services using the [SAGAR WASH](https://sagar-wash-f4986.web.app/) website. And this website was built using react, express, firebase, bootstrap, and a few other third-party libraries. I have used REDUX TOOLKIT for app state management.

- Itâ€™s responsive.
- It has full authentication and authorization system.
- It has an online card payment system where users can make payments of their ordered service.
- It has two different user role systems.
- A normal user can order a service and in the dashboard, they can see their order history and if an order is not - paid yet then the user can cancel that order.
- Admin can see all the order history and if a particular order is not paid yet then the admin can cancel the order
- Admin can see all the details of an order.
